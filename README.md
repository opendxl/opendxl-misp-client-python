## Overview

The MISP DXL Python client library provides a high level wrapper for
invoking the
[MISP REST APIs](https://misp.gitbooks.io/misp-book/content/automation/#automation-api)
via the [Data Exchange Layer](http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx)

This client requires the
[MISP DXL Service](https://github.com/opendxl/opendxl-misp-service-python)
to be running and available on the DXL fabric.
